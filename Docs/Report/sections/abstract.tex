\begin{abstract}
In this report we present a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) search implemented on a Parallella Board. We show the speed up attained by LSH over a n\"{a}ive implementation of KNN. We also compare the power consumed by a normal implementation of KNN on a Intel Xeon E5-1680 v2 processor available on a Apple Mac Pro and the Parallella Board.
