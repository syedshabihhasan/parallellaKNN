\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}
We presented a highly efficient KNN search system on the Parallella board using the million song dataset. 
We were successful in reducing the dataset size by two orders of magnitude. 
The employment of Locality Sensitive Hashing enabled us to reduce the number of comparisons by four orders of magnitude when compared to the the n\"{a}ive approach in theoretical analysis.
Employing the Epiphany multicore chip allows us to be, on an average, 26.5\% faster than  a Macbook Air using an Intel i7-2677M processor.
