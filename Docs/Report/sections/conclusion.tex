\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}
We presented a highly efficient KNN search system on the Parallella board using the million song dataset. 
We were successful in reducing the dataset size by two orders of magnitude. 
The employment of Locality Sensitive Hashing enabled us to reduce the number of comparisons by four orders of magnitude when compared to the the n\"{a}ive approach in theoretical analysis.
We compared the performance of the Parallella board with a Macbook Air, and a Mac Pro. The board exceeded the computation speed of the Macbook Air by 58\% and on the high end Mac Pro by 21.22\%. This speed up is attained on the Parallella while consuming 18 times and 4 times less power than the Mac Pro and the Macbook Air.
