\section{Introduction}
Low-power and low-cost devices usually entail low computational power and are generally not used for high performance computation. In this report we present a new platform, Parallella by Adapteva \cite{par01}, which is a low-cost (compared to a standard computation device) and a low-powered multi-multicore device. The Parallella board consists of two main processing units \textit{viz.} the dual core ARM A9 and the 16-core Epiphany co-processor. We measure this platform's performance and compare it with  a standard laptop and a high performance computer. Our measurements are based on computing K nearest neighbours on the Million Song dataset\cite{Bertin-Mahieux2011, msd01}. We measure the performance across the computation time and the power consumption dimension. We also use Locality Sensitive Hashing to speed up the KNN search.

The report is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} presents a background of the hardware and theoretical basis of the locality sensitive hashing. Section \ref{sec:methodology} describes the specifics of the methodology we used for LSH. Section \ref{sec:measurements} describes the results we obtained. We conclude in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
